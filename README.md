**miss-quote** is a Discord bot that sits in on your D&D session and listens to the adventures, so the evening ends up with a record instead of in everyone's half-memory of it. When the bot leaves it summarizes what happened, and next time you can ask: "what happened last session" and a bard recounts the night. It gets up to other shenanigans too.

Walk into a film line and it says the line out loud, then asks the room where it came from and pays whoever gets it first. Swear and it fines you, out loud, *Demolition Man* style. It keeps a running tally of who owes what and publishes the standings under the voice channel's name.

**This container needs no GPU.** Transcription and synthesis are calls to [Wyoming](https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming) servers, and summaries are a call to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — those are what want the hardware. Budget for one, and let this share it. The [About page](https://miss-quote.wars.beer/about/) has the shape of the pipeline.

It began as a hard fork of [Leehyunbin0131/Discord-Realtime-STT-Bot](https://github.com/Leehyunbin0131/Discord-Realtime-STT-Bot), which ran `faster-whisper` on a local GPU.

## Made with vibes, not love

This whole thing was vibecoded, it doesn't deserve proper effort, what it does isn't worth it. It was written as a joke, out of pure laziness, and yet somehow manages to do its job anyway. Anyone is welcome to it, but it comes with as much guarantee as effort that went into it: none.

## Documentation

Everything lives on the site. This file is the short version.

| Page | What is on it |
|---|---|
| **[About](https://miss-quote.wars.beer/about/)** | How the pipeline is split, the transcript format, the speech path, the tool contract, and what changed from upstream |
| **[Installation](https://miss-quote.wars.beer/installation/)** | Prerequisites, the Discord application, Docker and Kubernetes, volumes, development, and cutting a release |
| **[Configuration](https://miss-quote.wars.beer/configuration/)** | `config.yaml` in full — every server key, every tool, every setting, and every environment variable |

## What it does

Audio handling is local and serial; transcription is remote and parallel. Everything downstream is a **tool** that reads the utterance stream or the sealed session, opted into per server:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`quotes`](https://miss-quote.wars.beer/configuration/#quotes) | Answers the channel with the film line it just walked into, then asks where it came from |
| [`summary`](https://miss-quote.wars.beer/configuration/#summary) | Writes down what happened once the bot leaves, and reads it back out loud when somebody asks |
| [`scoreboard`](https://miss-quote.wars.beer/configuration/#scoreboard) | Keeps a running balance per person and publishes the standings under the voice channel's name |
| [`tts`](https://miss-quote.wars.beer/configuration/#tts-tool) | Says things out loud. The only thing that plays anything |
| [`verbal-morality`](https://miss-quote.wars.beer/configuration/#verbal-morality) | Fines a speaker out loud for the wrong word, after *Demolition Man* |

## Quick start

```bash
docker run -d --name miss-quote \
  -e DISCORD_TOKEN="$DISCORD_TOKEN" \
  -e WYOMING_HOST=asr.internal \
  -e TTS_HOST=tts.internal \
  -v "$PWD/config.yaml:/config/config.yaml:ro" \
  -v miss-quote-transcripts:/transcripts \
  -v miss-quote-speech:/speech \
  ghcr.io/beer-wars/miss-quote:latest
```

Everything a deployment **points at** is an environment variable — see [`.env.example`](.env.example). Everything about how it **behaves**, and which servers it behaves that way in, is [`config.yaml`](config.yaml), which is commented in full.

A server that is not listed in `config.yaml` is never joined. That direction is deliberate: joining no server is something you notice and fix, while recording a server the bot should not have been in is not something you can take back.

Runtime requirements are a reachable Wyoming ASR server, a writable volume at `SPEECH_DIR`, and a single replica. The rest is on the [installation page](https://miss-quote.wars.beer/installation/).

## Development

```bash
make test                          # the suite, inside the image CI uses
make test PYTEST_ARGS="-k config"  # a narrower run
make validate-quotes               # the quote file and the config's additions; PyYAML only
make help                          # everything else
```

The suite runs in the container rather than against whatever interpreter is on the machine — there is no second recipe that can drift from the one CI uses, and no host Python to be the wrong version.

## Deployment

GitHub Actions builds the image and pushes it to GHCR. **Cutting a git tag is the deploy action**; pushing to `main` produces `latest` and a sha tag, neither of which is orderable.

```bash
git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0
```

## The site

The documentation site is a Jekyll build of [`docs/`](docs/), served by GitHub Pages at [miss-quote.wars.beer](https://miss-quote.wars.beer). To preview it locally:

```bash
cd docs && bundle install && bundle exec jekyll serve
```

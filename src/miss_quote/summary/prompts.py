"""
What the model is told to do with a transcript, and with a summary.

A closed set shipped with the image, read from `resources/prompts.yaml`, which a
server adds to under `prompts:` and selects from by name. Named rather than
written inline at the point of use so that the two places a prompt is chosen —
the summary and the retelling — are one word each in the config file, and so a
server that wants a different wording writes it once and uses it in both.

The file also carries `instructions:`, which nothing selects: standing briefs the
code asks for by name, for the places a prompt is fixed rather than configured.
They are loaded here because the file has one reader, and one reader is what
keeps a fragment worth sharing shared.

Prose lives in the YAML and the rules for filling it live here. The file carries
the text, the fragments shared between prompts, and which prompt does each job
when a channel does not say; this module carries the two substitutions and the
refusal to run on a name nothing answers to.

Where a prompt's output **goes** is the thing that decides how it is written, and
the difference is not cosmetic:

- `recap` and `minutes` are read, in a Discord message. Markdown renders there,
  so they are free to use it.
- `bard` is **spoken**, by a synthesizer, which reads an asterisk out as a word
  and a bullet as nothing at all. It says so at some length for that reason, and
  it ends the story itself rather than trailing off — a channel's `closing` is
  off unless somebody asks for it, so the sign-off is the only thing telling the
  room the tale finished rather than stopped.

Why `bard` spends several lines establishing that the narrator was not there is
written above the prompt itself, which is where somebody would delete it.

Every prompt states the shape of what it is given, because the script it
receives has no timestamps in it: the order is the order things were said, and
nothing in the text says so on its own.

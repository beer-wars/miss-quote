"""
Per-session JSONL transcript writer.

One file per connection to a voice channel, one JSON object per utterance,
appended and flushed as produced. The file is named for the moment the bot
joined and keeps that name until it leaves, so a session spanning midnight stays
in one file and a reconnect starts a new one.

Files are filed under `<guild>/<channel>/`, so the path carries the origin of
every utterance and the lines themselves do not have to repeat it.

Whether a session is written down at all is qualified by `transcript.schedule`,
which is how a deployment says when an evening may start being recorded. The
question is asked once, when the session opens, and its answer holds until the
session seals: an evening that started on the record stays on it until everybody
disconnects. One opened outside every window is transcribed and answered like
any other and writes nothing down, so it seals as an empty session and takes its
own file away again.

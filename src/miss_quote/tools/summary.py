"""
Writes down what happened in a voice channel, and reads it back when asked.

Two halves of one idea, which is that a transcript is raw material and nobody
wants to read one.

**Writing it down.** When a session seals, the JSONL is reduced to a speaker-and-
text script, handed to a model with a named prompt, filed beside the transcript
it came from, and put in a text channel. That is `handle_finished`, and it is the
only tool that uses that moment: everything else here works on the utterance
stream while a conversation is still going.

What is written about is the **sitting** rather than the session, where a room is
on a capture schedule. A window — `Wed 17:00-00:00` — is a stretch of clock
somebody named, and a room empties and fills several times inside one: people
leave, the bot is dragged next door, a pod restarts. Each of those is its own
connection and its own transcript, and none of them is the evening. So a session
that opened inside one occurrence of the window is summarized together with every
other session filed inside it, under the name of the one that opened the sitting,
and each seal rewrites that same account rather than filing another beside it.
A session that opened outside every window is nobody's sitting and is written
about on its own — a room put on the record by hand is a deliberate account of
one conversation. See `summary.store.Sitting`.

**The post is rewritten on every seal too**, not only the file. Four seals that
leave one file on disk and four messages in a text channel is the same evening
told four times, and the four are indistinguishable at a glance: each is headed
with when the *sitting* opened, so they all carry the same date and time. So the
account goes up once and is edited in place as the evening grows, and only an
account that outgrows what one message holds moves — leaving a pointer where it
was. That is `bot.announcer`'s business; this tool says which account is which,
by handing it a header that is stable for a whole sitting.

**Reading it back.** Somebody says "Miss Quote, what happened last session" and
the bot tells them, out loud, having run the stored summary through a second
prompt that turns a thing you read into a thing you say. That is
`handle_utterance`, and the whole difficulty in it is the several seconds of
inference between the question and the answer. The bot fills them with a phrase
rendered at startup — and, crucially, **starts the inference before it starts
saying it**, so the announcement covers the wait rather than being followed by
one. A channel that names a clip gets music over whatever is left of the wait
after the announcement runs out. See `_recall`.

Three things sit under that sentence and are not in it. One evening is not always
one session, so what is retold is the whole run of them rather than the newest;
`summary.store` is where that is put back together. "Last session" is not always
what is meant — sessions get skipped, and other things happen in the channel in
between — so a trigger is the start of a question rather than the whole of one,
and `summary.when` reads which evening out of what follows it. And the sentence
is not always one utterance: an ASR splits wherever the speaker paused, so it
arrives in halves about as often as whole. That break lands in one of two
places, and they are not the same problem. Before the trigger, neither half asks
anything, so the name is held for a few seconds and the next thing its speaker
says finishes the question — see `Summary._asked`. After it, the first half is a
whole question already, and answering it as it lands retells the wrong evening
rather than none, so a question that named no evening waits a moment to see
whether one is coming — see `Summary._clause`.

**Showing it as it is said.** A room may also watch itself: `post_transcripts`
keeps the last ten lines in one message in the same text channel, rewritten as
the room talks rather than posted line by line. Ten is a maximum rather than a
promise — a ring is bounded by lines and a message by characters, so a room
talking in paragraphs shows fewer of them, oldest dropped first. See
`_fitting`, and note that the alternative is not showing nine lines instead of
ten: cutting the block at a character takes the fence off the front of it. It is off unless a channel asks,
and deliberately so — a transcript on disk is a file with a retention window,
while the same words in a text channel are permanent, searchable, and readable by
people who were never in the room.

The message is pinned while it is live, so a room that is talking can reach it
without scrolling — and so that a feed left behind by a process that went away
mid-session is findable by the next one, which sweeps it up rather than posting
beside it. Deleting a message unpins it, so nothing has to be undone on the way
out. That is all `bot.ticker`'s business; this tool says what the block reads.

It comes down when the room does. A sealed session is everybody having left, and
a feed left up from then on is the last thing said on the way out sitting in the
channel looking current — so the message is deleted as the session seals, before
the summary that replaces it is even asked for. What the evening leaves behind is
the summary.

The writing is a service rather than part of the utterance path, which is what
keeps it inside Discord's rate limit. Editing a message is about five requests
every five seconds per channel, so `handle_utterance` only adds to a ring and one
loop per room writes what has changed and then waits out
`transcript_refresh` — measured from the end of the write, so a slow
Discord slows the feed instead of queueing behind it. Nothing is written unless
something was said. See `Summary._ticking` and `bot.ticker`.

**Everything is per voice channel, under `monitored_channels`.** A server's rooms
are not interchangeable: one is where a game night happens and one is where two
people are debugging something, and a bot that summarizes every room it was ever
dragged into is writing files nobody asked for and posting them where everybody
can read them. The mapping doubles as the switch — a channel that is not in it is
not summarized, is not posted, and does not answer the question either.

Keys are matched through the same `slugify` that names the transcript directory,
so what is written in the config file is exactly the directory the summaries land
in, and a channel called "General Voice" is `general-voice` in both places.

        Summarize what a sealed session was part of, if anybody asked for that room.

        The gate comes first and costs nothing: a channel nobody listed is not
        read, not sent anywhere, and not written about. A conversation too short
        to have been one is dropped just after, because a summary of four lines
        is longer than the four lines.

        **What gets summarized is the sitting, not the session.** A room on a
        capture schedule empties and fills several times in an evening, and each
        of those is its own connection and its own transcript; what somebody
        wants an account of is the evening. So a session that opened inside one
        of the window's occurrences is summarized together with every other
        session filed inside it, and the account is written under the name of the
        one that opened the sitting — every seal rewrites that same file, and the
        evening leaves one account rather than four overlapping ones. See
        `Sitting`.

        A session that opened outside every window is nobody's sitting and is
        summarized on its own, which is what it was before any of this: a room
        put on the record by hand is a deliberate account of one conversation,
        and the sessions on either side of it were deliberately not kept.

        A failure anywhere costs the summary and nothing else. The transcripts
        are untouched and can be summarized again by hand, which is why nothing
        here writes a partial result or posts one.

        The live feed comes down first, before the model is asked anything. A
        sealed session is the room having emptied, and what a feed would show
        from then on is the last thing somebody said on their way out, sitting
        in the channel looking current — for as long as a summary takes to
        write, if it were taken down at the end instead.

        What the channel is left holding is one account of the evening, the same

        Go and look at the notes, out loud.

        The order of these steps is the feature, and each of them is where it is
        for a reason:

        The **lookup comes first**, because it is a file read and costs nothing.
        A bot that announced it was going to look and then found nothing has
        said something it has to take back.

        The **completion is started before the preamble is played**, not after.
        `Speaker.play` returns when the clip has finished, so starting the model
        on the next line would put the several seconds of inference *after* the
        announcement meant to cover them — which is the silence this whole
        arrangement exists to remove.

        The **preamble is a cached phrase**, rendered at startup, so it begins on
        a file read rather than a synthesizer round trip.

        And the **retelling is awaited last**, by which point the model has had
        the length of the announcement to work in. If it needed longer, the wait
        is what is left of it rather than all of it — which is what the music is
        for. `Tts.play_held` takes the completion rather than its result and
        plays the two as one clip, so a channel that named a clip hears
        something for the rest of the wait and a channel that did not hears
        exactly what it always did.

        The **backoff is checked between the lookup and the announcement**, once
        it is known which evening was asked for. Somebody asking twice for the
        same story is what it is there to stop; somebody asking for a different
        one is asking a different question and gets an answer. It is *recorded*
        at the end, once the story has actually been told: the ask that arrives
        during one is dropped by `_telling` rather than by this, and a window
        measured from the start of a minute of narration is most of the way
        through by the time anybody could use it.

        And an ask that **named no evening waits to see whether one is coming**,
        for as long as `_clause` says. The wait runs *beside* the preamble
        rather than in front of it, which is what makes it free: "let me go look
        at my notes" is true whichever night is meant, so the channel hears the
        bot answer immediately either way.

        The completion is started on the evening in hand **before** that wait
        finishes, and thrown away in the one case where the channel names a
        different one. A question that named its evening in one breath, and one
        that never names it at all, both go exactly the way they always did; the
        only ask that pays for a second lookup is the one that changed its mind
        mid-sentence, and it pays while the preamble is still playing.

        What is **not** waited for is an evening the backoff has already
        blocked. It is dropped where it always was — the alternative is holding
        the channel open on the chance that the clause names some other night,
        which is a wait nobody hears the end of, and the ask was going to be
        dropped today regardless.

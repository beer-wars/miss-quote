"""
The Verbal Morality Bot, after Demolition Man.

Listens for words the server has decided against and, on hearing one, announces
the fine out loud in the channel it was said in.

The credits are imaginary but they are counted, by somebody else: the fine is
handed to the server's `scoreboard`, which is what keeps a balance, writes it
down, and puts the worst of it in the voice channel topic. A server that has not
enabled one gets the announcement and no tally, which is said once at startup
rather than left to be noticed.

Saying it out loud is somebody else's as well. This tool decides what the fine
is and how loudly to announce it; the server's `tts` tool owns the words, the
chime in front of them, and the voice connection they go out over. A server with
no `tts` counts fines and says nothing, on the same terms and reported the same
way.

A repeat offender is announced more and more quietly. Being fined is the joke,
and a joke told fifteen times in five minutes is a denial of service on the
conversation, so the announcement backs off toward `settings.fines.volume_floor`
as somebody keeps earning them. See `RecentViolations`.

Past a point, turning the sentence down is not enough and it stops being said at
all. A speaker gets `settings.fines.dampen_after` fines read out in full inside
`settings.fines.dampen_seconds`, and once that is spent a single-credit fine is
the chime on its own — the room has heard the wording, and what is left to convey
is that it happened. A fine worth more than one credit is always said in full,
being a thing somebody has just done rather than the one the channel has heard
all evening. Off unless a deployment asks for it. See `RecentAnnouncements`.

For the same reason a violation earned while an announcement is already playing
is counted and not announced. The speaker plays one clip at a time and returns
when it is finished, so waiting for a turn would leave the channel working
through a backlog of fines for things said a minute ago.

A speaker fined again within `settings.fines.repeat_seconds` gets the second
wording — "you are also fined" — because reading the whole sentence out again
sounds like a bot that has lost track of what it just said.

The announcement names the fine and never the word, so somebody who missed it
can ask: "what did I say" inside `settings.fines.recall_seconds` is answered with
whatever they were last fined for. The window is the whole gate, which is what
keeps a phrase that common from being one the tool is always answering — outside
it the question is somebody talking to the room. See `_recall`.

What the server writes down are stems. Each is expanded at startup into the
endings it is said with, so a list stays a list of words rather than a list of
conjugations; `utils.stems` does the growing.

The name in the announcement is the one the transcript uses, which is the roster
name from `users` where a server has set one and the Discord display name
otherwise. Nothing has to be configured twice.

Because the roster is known before anybody speaks, and so is the shape of the
sentence, most of what the tool will ever have to say can be rendered at startup
rather than while the channel waits for it. See `prewarm`.

"""
Answers the channel with the film line it just walked into.

Listens for a trigger phrase and, on hearing one, says the associated quote out
loud where it was said. The pairs come from a YAML file — a film, and under it
the phrases that set its lines off — so adding a quote is a key rather than a
deployment.

That file is the deployment's list, and a server may write its own on top of it
under `additional_quotes`, in the same shape and read by the same rules. A
trigger written there is what that server hears whatever the shipped file says
the phrase answers with: the shared list is what a deployment agrees on rather
than what it is held to. Titles are not what collides — the list is keyed on the
trigger and carries the title on each quote — so a title written in both places
is one title with everything either of them said under it. See `_added` and
`_merged`.

A server whose own list is long enough to be worth its own file writes, in place
of the quotes, one string saying where to go and get them — a path on disk, or a
URL, downloaded once on the way up. What comes back is the same list in the same
shape, held to the same rules and merged the same way; all that has changed is
that the config file names it rather than holding it. See `_elsewhere`.

A trigger appears once within one of those. Nesting under the title makes it a
key, so a repeat under one title is not something the format can express at all;
a repeat across two titles is refused for the same reason rather than being
allowed to mean something a repeat under one title could not. A phrase worth
answering several ways says so with a list of lines, and one of them is drawn
each time it fires — written out rather than inferred from a repeated key, which
would have relied on the parser keeping something the format does not promise to
keep. See `_load`.

A trigger that has just fired goes quiet for a while — five minutes by default.
The joke is the recognition, and a channel that says "cool" four times in a
minute does not want "Shiny." four times back. The backoff is per trigger rather
than per speaker: what wears out is the line, not the person who set it off, and
a trigger with several answers spends all of them at once for the same reason.
See `RecentQuotes`.

A server may also answer only some of what it hears. `chance` is the odds a
trigger is answered at all, and everything by default; a server that turns it
down gets a bot the channel is never quite sure is going to say anything, which
is a different joke from one that always does. The roll is per utterance and
spends nothing when it loses — the trigger is not put on backoff, and the next
time somebody says it, it is a fresh coin. See `_answering`.

A line waits for whoever set it off to stop talking — a second by default. An
ASR returns utterances rather than sentences and breaks wherever the speaker
paused, so a trigger arrives in the middle of a thought about as often as at the
end of one, and answering the moment it lands talks over the rest of what
somebody was saying. Every further utterance from that speaker starts the wait
again, so what is waited out is the speaker finishing rather than a fixed pause,
and nobody else's talking holds their line up. See `_finished`.

A line that has just been said is also a question. For a few seconds afterwards
the channel can name the title it came from — "what is Firefly" — and whoever
does is paid a credit through the server's `scoreboard`, which is the same board
`verbal-morality` takes them off. The first correct answer takes the round, and a
second inside the tie window is paid as well: two people arriving at the same
title half a second apart both knew it. See `Round`.

Whoever set the line off is barred from their own round. They have the trigger
and the title in front of them and had to recall neither, so a round they could
win is one anybody can farm by reading the quote file out loud. An attempt costs
them credits and is said so out loud, because a rule nobody is told about is one
everybody keeps testing.

Every one of those is announced, and unlike a fine none of them opens with a
chime: a flourish is for an interruption, and these answer a question the channel
was already being asked. Somebody paid on a tie gets the second wording — "you
are also awarded".

Nothing said here is dropped for landing while something else is playing, which
is the other difference from a fine. A fine interrupts a conversation that was
about something else, so a backlog of them is a channel being read things it has
moved on from; everything this tool says is an answer to something it just said
itself, and a round that pays somebody without saying so reads as having missed
them. Announcements wait their turn on the speaker and come out in the order they
were earned.

The saying is the server's `tts` tool, which owns the words and the voice
connection; this one decides what they are. A server with no `tts` still runs its
rounds and still pays them, silently, and is told so at startup.

Because both the triggers and the lines are a closed set known before anybody
speaks, the whole list can be rendered at startup rather than while the channel
waits for it, and so can both wordings for everybody on the roster. See `prewarm`.

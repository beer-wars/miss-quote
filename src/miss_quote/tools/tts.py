"""
The tool that speaks, and the only thing that plays anything.

Every other tool answers out loud by finding this one in its `Toolbox` and
handing it a sentence. That is the whole point of it being a tool rather than a
module: what a server can hear is something the config file elects into, a tool
that is missing is reported where every other missing tool is, and the cache, the
chime library, the volume and the voice connection are behind one door instead of
three imports and a composition step in whoever happened to need it first.

`play` decides how a clip reaches Discord, and the decision is worth stating
because it is the difference between free and not. A phrase with nothing in front
of it and nothing to be done to it goes out exactly as it was stored — Opus
packets, no decode, no encode, no resample. A chime, or any volume below the
channel's own, means samples: a chime is a hand-placed WAV that has to be joined
onto the front, and a gain is a multiplication, and neither is a thing you can do
to an encoded packet. The speaker makes that call from the gain and the type it
is given, so this decides only whether to hand over a phrase or a stream.

`play_chime` is the other end of the same decision: a flourish and no sentence,
for a tool whose announcement the channel already knows by heart and which has
only to say that it happened. Nothing is synthesized, and nothing is cached.

`play_held` is `play` for a sentence that does not exist yet. A tool that has to
go and think before it can answer hands over whatever is doing the thinking, and
gets music under the wait and the answer straight after it, as one clip. See
`audio.hold` for why an open-ended clip is not simply fed to the player.

`enqueue` and `run` are the other half. A tool that can work out at startup what
it will have to say says so, and this renders it in the background while the bot
is already in the channel — rather than each tool blocking the start-up on its
own synthesizer round trips. Rendering is serial process-wide, which the cache
enforces; see `SpeechCache.warm`.

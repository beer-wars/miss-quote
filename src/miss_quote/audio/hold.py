Music under a wait, for a tool that has already said it will be a moment.

The bot answers a question it has to go and think about by saying so and then
going quiet. The announcement covers the first second or two of that; this
covers the rest of it, so a channel hears something being worked on rather than
a room nobody is in.

It is an envelope over a loop rather than a clip that is played. Nothing knows
in advance how long the wait is — that is the entire reason there is a wait —
so the audio has to be able to go on indefinitely and then stop on a signal
that arrives from somewhere else. What that means in practice is three things
this module has to get right.

**It loops.** The clip is read once and yielded frame by frame, wrapping at the
end. A seam that clicks is a property of the file rather than of this, so what
belongs in the chime directory for this purpose is a short passage that meets
itself, not a track.

**It fades.** Up quickly, because the silence it is covering has already begun
by the time it starts; down slowly, because what replaces it is a sentence, and
music that stops dead a beat before somebody starts talking sounds like a fault.
The envelope is a volume rather than a multiplier and moves linearly through it,
which `audio.gain` turns into the amplitude that sounds that way: a fade that is
even to listen to rather than one that arrives all at once and then crawls. It
is constant within a frame, and a fade of two seconds is a hundred steps of a
hundredth of the loudness it is heading for, which is nowhere near coarse enough
to hear as stepping.

**It waits.** Every other clip in this process is finite and is fed to the
player as fast as it can be produced, because the end of it is never far away.
An indefinite one cannot be: the player takes exactly one frame every 20 ms and
never more, so a loop that yielded as fast as it could would fill memory with
audio nobody has heard yet for as long as the model is thinking. Frames are
handed over against a wall clock instead, kept a fixed head start ahead of what
the player will have consumed. That is a stand-in for asking the player how full
it is, and an accurate one, because its rate is fixed and it only ever falls
behind.

    A clip too short to fill a single frame is no clip at all. It is reported by
    whoever read it, and here it simply produces nothing — the wait is silent,

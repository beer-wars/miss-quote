"""
Rendered speech, kept so a phrase is only ever synthesized once.

One layer: Opus packets in an Ogg container under `SPEECH_DIR/cache`, one packet
per 20 ms, exactly as Discord takes them. About a tenth the size of the samples
they came from, and playable, so you can hear what the bot actually said.

Storing what Discord wants rather than what the synthesizer produced is what
makes a cached phrase free to play. `stream` hands the packets over and
`is_opus` tells discord.py to send them untouched: no resample, no encode, no
decode, nothing per play at all. The cost of that is that the stored bitrate is
the delivered bitrate — see `audio.opus` — and that a clip which has to be
*changed* on the way out has to be decoded first, which is what `Phrase.pcm` is
for and what any volume below full needs.

There was a second layer in front of this one, holding the same packets in
memory. It was measured at a quarter of a millisecond off the way to playback,
against a frame of twenty, and it did not even save a filesystem round trip: the
reaper ages clips by mtime, so every hit calls `os.utime` whether or not it read
the file. What it cost was an eviction policy, a bound, and a setting to tune
the bound with. It is gone, and a hit is now a file read.

Which makes the directory load-bearing rather than optional. An unwritable or
absent one no longer costs only the persistence — with nowhere to put a clip,
every phrase is synthesized again every time it is said, and `warm` declines to
render anything at all rather than paying a synthesizer for audio that would be
thrown away.

Only rendered speech lives here. Clips nobody synthesized — a chime a tool plays
ahead of what it has to say — are the operator's rather than this process's, and
live in their own directory; see `audio.chimes`.

Rendered speech is reaped at startup once it has gone unplayed for long enough.
See `_reap`.

A caller that can work out in advance what it will have to say can render it
before it is needed with `warm`, which costs nothing for a phrase already held.

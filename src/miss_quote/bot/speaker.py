"""
Playing a tool's audio back into the voice channel it came from.

Discord's player is a thread. It asks an `AudioSource` for exactly one frame
every 20 ms and stops the moment it gets anything short of one, so a clip that
is still being synthesized cannot simply be handed over as a file. The sources
here are the buffer between the two: filled from the event loop as chunks
arrive, drained by the player thread a frame at a time, so playback starts on
the first chunk rather than waiting for the last.

There are two of them because there are two forms a clip can arrive in.
`OpusStream` carries packets the cache already holds encoded, and says so
through `is_opus`, which is discord.py's signal to send them untouched — no
encoder is even constructed. `PCMStream` carries samples, which is what anything
that has to be *changed* on the way out needs: a gain is a multiplication, and
there is nothing to multiply in an encoded packet.

Which one a clip gets is decided in `play` and turns on the volume alone. At
full volume there is nothing to do to the audio, so it goes out as it was
stored; below it, the clip is decoded, scaled, and re-encoded by discord.py as
it always was.

No ffmpeg is involved in either. The audio is already what Discord wants, and
libopus is present for receiving regardless.

"""
The shipped prompts, and the contracts they carry.

A prompt is prose, so nothing here can check that it works — that takes a model
and a transcript. What it can check is that the instructions a prompt exists to
carry are still in it, because those are exactly what a tidy-up removes without
anybody noticing until something reads a stage direction out loud.

The loader is checked the other way round: against files written to be wrong, so
that a shipped file that is wrong says which part and stops.
